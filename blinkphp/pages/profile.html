				            <p>Lisa was the second member introduced to the public. She was the only person accepted to YG during the 2010 YG Audition in Thailand. In 2012, she was introduced through a teaser video called, “Who’s That Girl?” Being the first non-Korean idol in YG, Lisa’s presence has gotten many people curious about her talents. She has been acknowledged for her “elegant body ratio” and her “exotic visual.” Lisa is especially talented in dancing, even YG himself praises her. She knows four languages: Thai, Korean, English, and Japanese. She is also childhood friends with GOT7’s BamBam as they were both part of the dance crew “We Zaa Cool.” In July 2017, she briefly had her own show via OnStyle’s Attraction TV called “LISA TV.”</p>

					        <h3>Bio</h3>
				            <p>Lisa was the second member introduced to the public. She was the only person accepted to YG during the 2010 YG Audition in Thailand. In 2012, she was introduced through a teaser video called, “Who’s That Girl?” Being the first non-Korean idol in YG, Lisa’s presence has gotten many people curious about her talents. She has been acknowledged for her “elegant body ratio” and her “exotic visual.” Lisa is especially talented in dancing, even YG himself praises her. She knows four languages: Thai, Korean, English, and Japanese. She is also childhood friends with GOT7’s BamBam as they were both part of the dance crew “We Zaa Cool.” In July 2017, she briefly had her own show via OnStyle’s Attraction TV called “LISA TV.”</p>
