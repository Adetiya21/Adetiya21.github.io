# Random name picker (with javascript and html)

Works great for raffles, lotteries, etc. It's basically like pulling names out of a hat digitally. 

Add your list of names to the file random-names.txt. Each name should be on it's own line. It should work with Chinese names and basic punctuation

Requires a webserver but will also work without in browsers like Safari and Firefox but not Chrome.
